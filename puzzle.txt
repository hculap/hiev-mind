This conundrum, a variation on a lying/truth problem, has famously been called the hardest logic puzzle ever. You meet three gods on a mountaintop. One always tells the truth, one always lies and one tells the truth or lies randomly. We can call them Truth, False and Random. They understand English but answer in their own language, with ja or da for yes and noâ€”but you don't know which is which. You can ask three questions to any of the gods (and you can ask the same god more than one question), and they will answer with ja or da. What three questions do you ask to figure out who's who?
